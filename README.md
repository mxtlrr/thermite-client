# Thermite Client
Thermite is a simple Discord client. The main feature of Thermite is that it
is able to repeat a message every X minutes. It does this by:
1. Sending the first message
2. Waiting X minutes
3. Sending another message
4. Repeating

This allows for grinding for currency in servers with Dank Memer (*pls fish*)
and MEE6 (*!work*)
